# **A "To Do" List, written in Bash**

### How to begin
Simply copy the file and name it *.todo.sh* , then run (make sure to give the file the permission to execute):
> **./.todo.sh init**

Now you can use all of the script's options by only using: 
> **todo [option]**

Your list of tasks will now be displayed every time you open your terminal.
You can also view it any time by simply typing:
> **todo**

### Adding a new task to your list
To add a new task, execute this command:
> **todo add**

You will be prompted with instructions to add a title, the time and the date of the assignment. You can skip adding the time and date by simply clicking enter.

### Deleting an existing task
Run the command:
> **todo del**

You will see a numbered list of all the entries, simply input the number of the entry that you want deleted.

### Editing an existing task
Run the command:
> **todo edit**

Just like with *todo del* , you'll be prompted with the list of your tasks, input the number of the task that you want to edit. After that, choose whether you want to edit the title, the time, or the date.

### The help command
If you forget any of the above options, and want to see what they do, run the command:
> **todo help**
